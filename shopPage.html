			<td>This is the 4th edition of Nosh for Students, a book originally inspired by the author's son, Ben,
				who left for university with no cooking skills. Toasted sandwiches and Mars bars were his staple diet,
				but these didn't serve him too well! What was needed to encourage him to cook was an easily attainable taste of home,
				oh, and pictures with every recipe! Nosh for Students was born. 
				Since then, Joy has helped over 150,000 students get cooking with her straightforward and simple approach.
				Joy helps to take the chore out of cooking, giving students a taste of success and making the experience so much fun.</td>
